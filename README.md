# Group My Transactions Capstone Project

In this project I built a simple Rails app according to these [requirements](https://www.notion.so/Group-our-transactions-ccea2b6642664540a70de9f30bdff4ce). This app allows users to create projects for a university, create groups, and assign projects to groups.
